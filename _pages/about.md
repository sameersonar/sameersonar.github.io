I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in Prof. [Oskar Painter's](https://painterlab.caltech.edu/) group at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). My research interests broadly include Quantum optics, Quantum Optomechanics, and nanoscale devices.

I did my undergrad in Engineering Physics at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)
