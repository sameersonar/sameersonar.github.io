PhD candidate at the [Institute for Quantum Information and Matter](https://iqim.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/).

## My work and research

## My background and history
I received my Ph.D from the [UC-Berkeley School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu), my M.A. from the [Communication, Culture, and Technology program](http://cct.georgetown.edu) at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in [the Humanities program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/humanities/) at the University of Texas at Austin. For just under five years after receiving my Ph.D, I was at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) as a staff ethnographer. At BIDS, I was first a postdoctoral scholar, then became a principal investigator and led several research and education efforts, including the instituteâ€™s Data Science Studies efforts and the [Best Practices in Data Science](https://osf.io/ctfqn/) series.
