# Hi, I’m Sameer 👋

I’m a **quantum research scientist and physicist at Applied Materials**, working at the intersection of **quantum hardware, integrated photonics, and semiconductor manufacturing**.

My work focuses on **scaling quantum computing hardware out of the lab and into manufacturable, reliable systems**.  
The core idea is simple—but hard:

> **Leverage state-of-the-art CMOS fabrication, advanced materials, and 3D semiconductor packaging to dramatically accelerate the path to useful quantum computation.**

This means building hardware that is:
- Compatible with **foundry-scale CMOS processes**
- Integrable with **cryogenic quantum systems**
- Designed for **yield, variability, and scalability** from day one

## Previously
I completed my PhD in **Applied Physics at Caltech**, in **Prof. Oskar Painter’s lab**, where my research tackled one of the hardest challenges in quantum hardware:

> **How do we interconnect superconducting quantum processors using silicon photonics?**

My doctoral work spanned:
- Superconducting and optomechanical quantum systems  
- Microwave-to-optical transduction  
- Integrated silicon photonics  
- Nanofabrication, cryogenic measurements, and device physics  
- Bridging fundamental quantum science with scalable semiconductor platforms

## Earlier
Before Caltech, I earned my undergraduate degree in **Engineering Physics from IIT Bombay**, where I built a strong foundation in:
- Electromagnetics, solid-state physics, and quantum mechanics  
- Experimental physics and engineering-driven problem solving  
- Thinking fluently across **theory, fabrication, and measurement**

## What you’ll find here
This GitHub hosts a mix of:
- Research code and simulations  
- Data analysis, modeling, and automation tools  
- Explorations at the boundary of **quantum systems, photonics, and scalable hardware**

I’m especially interested in problems where **deep physics meets real-world constraints**—and where strong engineering choices are as important as new ideas.
